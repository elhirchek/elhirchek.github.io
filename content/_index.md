# Welcome!
I'm a self-taught software developer, and on this website, I will document things I learn, such as system programming, computer architecture, networking, and various other technical subjects. Hopefully, you'll find value in the (future) posts. I'm always happy to receive feedback as well!

If you whish to know me more, check the [about me](/about) page.
