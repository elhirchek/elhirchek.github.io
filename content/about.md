# About me
<hr class="h">

Welcome to my blog.

My name's Khaled. 
I'm passionate about computers and how they work, both in terms of hardware and software. I'm a self-taught, focusing on system programming, networking, devops, and various other technical subjects.

I strongly believe in the principles of "[KISS (Keep it simple stupid)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)", "[DRY (Don't repeat your self)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)" and "[Extreme programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming)" methodology.

My main programming languages: are C, GO, Python, Bash, and Powershell.

My motivation for this website is to explain things in the way I wish they had been explained to me, delving as deeply as possible with minimal abstraction.

Feel free to address any issues in my understanding of things. I would be happy to learn new things from all of you.
